## Arroz con Pollo Colombian Style 
Outline of steps for making a colombian traditional dish which essentially translates to chicken and rice. First, you cook the chicken breast (chicken broth) for 25 mins. Once cool, shred and set aside. Then you add vegetables to a medium pot - onions, green peppers, garlic, and red bell peppers. Next, you add the rice, carrots, green beens and cook for about 20 mins more. Lastly, add the shredded chicken mixing thoroughly and cook for 5 more minutes.
